This repository contains a simple ten-page website showcasing various content.

# 11245046 - David Asamoa Berko 

# Overview 

This website is designed to demonstrate different sections, layouts, and content across ten pages. It is a recreation of the Department of Computer Science's website. 

It is loosely based on the current design of the website but there are some differences.

According to the instructions, these are the pages I created:

1. The Home Page: Homepage introducing the Computer Science Department.
2. The About Page: Information about the department's history and mission.
3. The Students Page: Resource and information for students.
4. The Admissions Page: Information on the admissions process.
5. The Alumni Page: Information about Alumni events.
6. The Faculty Page: Profiles of faculty members.
7. The Research Page: Information about ongoing research and projects.
8. The News and Events Page: Details about departmental events.
9. The Industry Partners Page: Information about industry partners.
10. The Short Courses: Information about short courses run at the department.
